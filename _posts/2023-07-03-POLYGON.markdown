## Polygon Gas

A fee denominated in small fractions of ETH required to conduct a transaction on the open-source Ethereum blockchain.

The Ethereum gas fee exists to pay network validators for their work securing the blockchain and network.

Eth gas = gas units(limit) x (base fee + tip or priority fee)

The ether gas limit refers to the maximum amount of gas a user can consume to conduct a transaction.The standard limit on an Ethereum gas fee is 21,000 units.

Base fee acts as a reservation price to include transaction in the block. When the block is mined the base fee is â€˜burnedâ€™ðŸ”¥, removing it from circulation.

Base fee (max) for next block= Base fee (current) * 12.5%

With every block the base fee getting burned, a priority fee (tip) introduced via EIP-1559 to incentivize miners for including a transaction in the block.

Based upon Network congestion, the minimum cost to send transaction on Ethereum blockchian varies.
